 # Hotel Hell
*A horror game set in a haunted hotel.*

## The Project
This game was made primarily by me and Bethany Cawthorne with some help from Rhys Williams.
This Readme will focus on the elements that I contributed since it is here for my portfolio.

#### My Contributions:
* I made the first room, the hallway and some of the 3D assets (most assets were from a 3rd party source).
* I developed an inventory system.
* I produced a data structure that kept the game logic intact between scenes.
* I created a puzzle in the first room that acted as a tutorial for the game.
* The player movement was done by me.
* I also helped Rhys do the third room.

## The Game
In Hotel Hell, the player tries to solve some puzzles to escape the hotel before the time runs out!

### The Player
* Moves around with WASD.
* Looks around with the mouse.
* Pick up items with the 'F' key.
* Uses items with the 'E' key.
* Selects an item on the hot bar with the number keys.

### The First Room
* Done in two parts; the bathroom and the bedroom.
* The bathroom has writing on the wall that guides the player, acting as the tutorial.
* In the bathroom, the player needs to pick up a key to open the door.
* Once in the bedroom, the player must solve a puzzle to fix a key to leave the room.
* The glue was purposely made to be extra bright so as the player would see it quickly, this was also done to guide the player along the intended path.

### The Hallway
* The hallway acts as the transition scene between the hotel rooms and also contains the elevator that allows the player to win the game.
* The player has to locate a key card to get to the next bedroom.
* The next bedroom allows access to another bedroom which in turn brings the player back to the Hallway, now with a key card to the elevator.
* Once the elevator key card is obtained, the player can escape the hotel and win the game.

## Current State of Project
The project has been finished and I have moved on to another. I copied the repository here to be public for use in my portfolio.
